# Yes, it's an animated Hama bead Larry

<p class="blog-post-date">November 1, 2012</p>

I've been meandering about in the time-consuming and dimly lit world of pixel art lately. There should be a proper blog post about it shortly (don't worry, there'll be code too). But for now, I'd just like to share with you my first-ever animated GIF.
