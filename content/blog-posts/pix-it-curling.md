# Pix-it curling

Posted: November 7, 2011

I mentioned cURL in passing in the last blog post. In case you haven’t heard of it: it is a super-useful tool you can use to issue HTTP requests from the command line (and a whole slew of other stuff). Just thought I’d jot down a quick note on how to use it to play around with the pix-it HTTP handler.

It’s a breeze, really. So effortless! If you’ve installed cURL and vim (and added them to your PATH), you can do the whole command-line ninja thing and never take your fingers off the keyboard. Fiddler is a bit more -uh- fiddly for in that respect.

Here’s the work flow in it’s entirety. Repeat as necessary.
