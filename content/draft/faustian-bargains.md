# Faustian bargains

<p class="blog-post-date">February 8, 2025</p>

I think it’s time to revisit some doc the Faustian bargains we’ve made with technology.

What’s offered is always convenience, and we find it hard to resist. Convenience for attention, convenience for data, convenience for time. (Authenticity, humanity)

- Immediate benefit for delayed cost.
- Visible benefit for hidden cost.
- Concrete benefit for abstract cost.
