Indeed! Read anything, and read broadly. We are quickly becoming a culture with no memory, just a stream of events and reactions and reactions to reactions.

But I think in a time of upheaval and potentially radical societal change in the wake of technological shifts combined with naivete and blind faith in progress, I personally would ask people to read Weizenbaum's "Computer Power and Human Reason" and Postman's "Technopoly" specifically.

More Alan Kay by the way: "I like to say that in the old days, if you reinvented the wheel, you would get your wrist slapped for not reading. But nowadays people are reinventing the flat tire. I'd personally be happy if they reinvented the wheel, because at least we'd be moving forward. If they reinvented what Engelbart did we'd be way ahead of where we are now."
